# pcf-on-azure

This set of scripts attempts to automate the deployment of PCF (PAS + PKS) on Azure.

The first proposed step is to deploy a jumpbox in a chosen Resource Group, with all the tools and scripts required to install PCF. Instructions for installing the jumpbox are provided [here](https://github.com/npintaux/pcf-on-azure/tree/master/tf-jumpbox "Jumpbox installation instructions").
